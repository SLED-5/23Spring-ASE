We ask 3 people for their opinions about some TV series on several streaming platform.

## Interview

The first interviewee Mr. A pointed out several attributes:
- A TV series can feature some very famous actors, or starred by some new faces.
- The plot can be intensive or slow paced.
- There can be a lot of short episodes (< 40 mins), or fewer but longer episodes (> 40 mins)
- A show can be commonly disscussed, or has a narrow audience group
- Some TV shows are better to watch with others, while some are best to watch alone.
- Some productions are very expensive while some are of cheap-cost.

We then asked two people about the same 10 examples. (Duplicated attributes are taged with **S**)

The second interviewee Ms. B pointed out these attributes :
- **S**  Famous cast or not
- Some shows features good story telling while some features good visual effect.
- **S**  Expensive investment or cheap production
- Some shows are more profound, while some are just more entertaining.
- **S**  Longer/shorter episodes length

The third Interviewee Mr. C described the following attributes:
- Some shows feature diverse cast of different backgrounds while some are less diverse.
- Some shows are more novel in some aspects while some are conventional.
- **S**  Episodes length
- **S**  Famous cast or not
- **S**  Intensive/slowpaced plot

## Result

### Similarity

All three interviewees mentioned episodes length as an sigificant attributes. A and B both tend to consider TV series which is of longer episodes will more likely to have expensive investment. The interviewees also mentioned the fame of cast.

Both A and C mentioned whether the plot is intensive or not. And both A and B considered investment as an important attribute.

### Difference

Only A described the heat of discussion as an attribute. A tends to actively discover new things to watch from platforms like IMDb and social medias, while others more rely on streaming platforms' recommendation. That's probably the reason why only A gives this attribute. 

Only B gives an attribute to evaluate if a show is more profound and inspring or is more entertaining. She is also the only one that gives the attribute about good story telling. From the interview we learnt that B is in favor of the shows that leave an impact on the society and culture.  That's a different new level and point of view from other two interviewees.

Only C considers diversity as an important attribute of a show. He also gives novelty much attention. He is also the only one who is in favor of less-famous cast and rising stars. That makes senses since C describe himself as pioneer type of audience who is eager to see freshness in televison screen and the demand for TV shows to be more diverse is also a part of latest trend.   

It's interesting to see how diffirent people can be on finding things to watch on streaming platform. They have different tastes, discovering new shows in different ways, and evaluate same subjects with different points of view.
